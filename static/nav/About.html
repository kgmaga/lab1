		<article>
    <h1>Artist, Writer and Gamer</h1>
    <p>I honestly love to draw like literally I have a lot of artworks at home. Even though I didn't get
		to choose my passion course. I still intend to finish what I've started. 
	</p>
    <p>Writer, I wanted to become a writer like my grandfather although instead of diary... I want to share fantasy stories that can still
		relate to real-life problems. </p>
		<p> 	
		Gamer, I always wanted to play games that can really challenge my head.
	Like RTS games like Starcraft and Stellaris, since I want to command a grand army of my own. I also play FPS games 
	like R6 and L4D the more people the better.</p>

    <h1>My Friends</h1>
    <p>Tenshi-san, she's my literally back-to-back buddy. Partners to be exact, different hobbies but a toast is the best.
	</p>
    <p>Owl-san, my quiet buddy. The brains yet befriended a weirdo like me. We have similar hobbies and even though we're far away,
	we're still buddies for laifu. </p>
		<p>Abs-chan, the kohai power, who's literally artstyle is much more better than the senpai (I'm sad). Although, thanks to her I get new stuffs.</p>
